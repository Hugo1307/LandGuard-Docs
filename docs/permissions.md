# Permissions

LandGuard uses a permission-based system to control access to its commands and features. This allows server administrators to fine-tune which players or groups have access to specific actions, commands, and GUI interactions.

Permissions can be managed using any permissions plugin that supports Bukkit/Spigot API, such as:

- [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/)
- PermissionsEx
- GroupManager

### üîß How Permissions Work

Each command or feature in LandGuard is associated with a permission node. By default, all permissions are restricted to **Operators (OPs)** unless explicitly granted via a permissions plugin.

If a player lacks the necessary permission, they will receive a message indicating they don't have access to the command or feature.

- Combine with economy pricing for more granular control.
