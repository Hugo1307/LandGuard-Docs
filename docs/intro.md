### üõ†Ô∏è Core Features

- **Claim and Protect Land:** Players can create lands using `/lg land create`, then define their area using a stick and confirm it with `/lg confirm`. The land is immediately protected from griefing and unauthorized edits.
- **Interactive Management GUI:** Players can manage members, permissions, flags, and more through a clean GUI interface accessed via `/lg`.
- **Access Groups System:** Each land includes customizable access groups (`Visitor`, `Member`, `Admin`) that determine what each player can do‚Äîlike build, open chests, or manage other members.
- **Flag-Based Protections:** Server-wide events like lava flow, fire spreading, or mob spawning are controlled using flags, adding an extra layer of security beyond just player actions.
- **Economy Integration:** LandGuard supports Vault-based economy plugins, allowing server owners to assign costs for actions like land creation, renaming, expanding, or member promotion.
- **MineSphere Integration:** Players can access their lands via a web dashboard, and server data is automatically backed up to the cloud‚Äîensuring land data survives crashes or resets.
- **Fully Configurable:** All access groups, permissions, flags, and economy settings can be adjusted via the plugin‚Äôs configuration files. You can even define custom access groups!

### üåê Ideal For:
- **Survival Servers:** Protect player builds from trolls and accidents.
- **Roleplay Communities:** Grant rich control over who can interact with land and how.
- **Admin-Managed Worlds:** Monitor and assist players with flexible admin tools.
