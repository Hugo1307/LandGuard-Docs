LandGuard allows server administrators to create custom Access Groups directly through the configuration file.

To add a new group, navigate to `config.yml` and locate the `defaultAccessGroups` section. You can define a new group by providing a unique name, access level, and a list of permissions.


**Example:**

```yaml
- name: "Moderator"
  accessLevel: 1
  permissions:
    - "BREAK_BLOCKS"
    - "PLACE_BLOCKS"
    - "INTERACT"
    - "ENTER"
    - "MANAGE_MEMBERS"
```
